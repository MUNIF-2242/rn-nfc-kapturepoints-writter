# ðŸŽ¯ KapturePoints â€“ NFC-Based Vehicle Loyalty & Rewards Tracker

## Description

KapturePoints is a lightweight, NFC-based loyalty and rewards tracking system tailored for the automotive industry. Whether you're running a fuel station, car wash, auto service center, or dealership, KapturePoints makes customer retention seamless.

Designed to work with NTAG215 NFC tags, it stores a vehicleâ€™s or customerâ€™s unique ID directly on the tagâ€”placed on dashboards, keychains, or windshield stickers. A simple tap lets your system track refueling, maintenance, servicing, or car washes, update reward points, and log redemptionsâ€”all securely stored in AWS DynamoDB.
